# Chirp Stock Configs

Replacement Stock configs which improve on the ones which ship with Chirp, for use in EU.

These are csv files intended for use with CHIRP but which could be used with other software.
Each files contains a set of channels/frequencies for particular uses.

I will accept pull requests for adding more stock configs (such as repeaters for specific countries) for public freqencies.

## Usage
* Close Chirp.
* Clone this repo into ~/.chirp/stock_configs
* Open Chirp.
